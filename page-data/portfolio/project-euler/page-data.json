Project Euler isn't focused on the language used but rather the technique and problem solving necessary to come up with the right answer.</p>\n<p>Thus, in my spare time, I solve Project Euler questions in C++. This helps to hone my C++ skills and sharpen my problem-solving skills. Also, math is fun so doing these problems is a plus.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://projecteuler.net/profile/willatreee.png\" alt=\"badge\" title=\"Project Euler badge\"></p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/portfolio/project-euler","title":"Project Euler","languages":"Project Euler, C++","url":"https://projecteuler.net/progress=willatreee"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
