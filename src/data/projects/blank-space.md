Blank Space, inspired off of The Thoughts Room by The Quiet Place Project (now down), represents a space to type away worries and watch them fade away. Not only was this a fun project to practice JavaScript animation effects but it also served as a stress reliever as no one would judge what I typed. There's just something so satisfying as watching my stress dissolve into the pixels of my scren.
