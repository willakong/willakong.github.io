[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is an archive of interesting mathematical problems that can solved through programming languages. Project Euler isn't focused on the language used but rather the technique and problem solving necessary to come up with the right answer.

Thus, in my spare time, I solve Project Euler questions in C++. This helps to hone my C++ skills and sharpen my problem-solving skills. Also, math is fun so doing these problems is a plus.
