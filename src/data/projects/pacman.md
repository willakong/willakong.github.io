The classic Pac-Man game written in Java. Featuring a fancy start screen, new power-ups, status pane, player name, and sound effects.

This was one of my first programming projects where I probably spent way too long adding new features here and there. It was exciting being able to write a few lines of code and seeing how it made the game gain more personality.
