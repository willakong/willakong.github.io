I wanted to figure the inner workings of networks so I experimented with creating a local chatroom. Using the server-side app, you can host a server for people to chat on. Using the client-side app, you can join a server and chat with those on it. It uses TCP/IP sockets, the tkinter GUI library and a kickstart from [here](https://medium.com/swlh/lets-write-a-chat-app-in-python-f6783a9ac170).
